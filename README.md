DESCRIPTION

The LAX Flight Delay Predictor is a Python-based web application that leverages machine learning and weather data to estimate the probability of flight delays for departures from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Using historical flight records (2021â€“2024) combined with local weather conditions, the system trains an XGBoost classifier to model delay patterns and serves predictions through an interactive Dash dashboard.

Users interact with a guided, multi-page interface to select their airline, choose a destination airport, and specify flight details such as departure time, date, duration, and weather parameters. The app then displays the predicted delay probability with a gauge, a summary report table, and a route map, offering actionable insights for travelers.

INSTALLATION

1. Clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/flight_delay_app
	cd flight_delay_app

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

	python3 -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Ensure the data/ directory contains the required CSV files:

	- Airline datasets: AA.csv, AS.csv, DL.csv, UA.csv, WN.csv, SA.csv, JB.csv
	- LA weather: la_weather.csv (with header rows trimmed)
	- Global airport database: GlobalAirportDatabase.txt

EXECUTION

1. Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):
	
	source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

2. Run the application:
	
	python app.py

3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
